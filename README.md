# Healthcare QA System 

## Overview

This project provides an AI-powered healthcare question and answer system built using the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technique. It leverages the **MedQuAD dataset**, **LangChain**, **HuggingFace embeddings**, **FAISS**, and **DeepSeek R1** to deliver accurate, context-aware medical answers. The system is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** using **Streamlit** for a seamless user interface.
